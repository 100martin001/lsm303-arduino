h1. Pololu LSM303DLH Arduino Library

Release Date: 2011-1-20
http://www.pololu.com/

h2. Summary

This is a library for the Arduino that interfaces with the LSM303DLH.

h2. Getting Started

Install this library in the Arduino libraries folder. The folder should be named LSM303DLH and look like this:

pre. arduino/libraries/LSM303DLH

The board for the LSM303DLH can be purchased on "Pololu's website":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1250.
  
After receiving the board, make the following connections with wires:

pre. Arduino Uno/Duemilanove     LSM303DLH Carrier
                    5V  ->  VIN
                   GND  ->  GND
          Analog Pin 5  ->  SCL
          Analog Pin 4  ->  SDA
  
h2. Example Programs
  
Open the example code sketch by going to File->Examples->LSM303DLH->example_name

h3. Serial

Program the Arduino, and the accelerometer and magnetometer readings will be output to the serial monitor. Here is an example of what you will see:

pre. A X: -151 Y: 848 Z: -509 M X: 281 Y: -442 Z: 87
A X: -147 Y: 847 Z: -509 M X: 266 Y: -446 Z: 78
A X: -147 Y: 849 Z: -508 M X: 280 Y: -450 Z: 81

For calibration purposes it is useful to record the maximum and minimum magnetometer values you get when moving the compass through every possible orientation.

h3. Heading

Program the Arduino, and the degrees of the heading from the -Y axis will be output to the serial monitor.

h2. Command Reference

pre. vector a - the last reading of the accelerometer values.
vector m - the last reading of the magnetometer values.
vector m_max - the maximum magnetometer readings found, use for calibration.
vector m_min - the minimum magnetometer readings found, use for calibration.
LSM303DLH() - Constructor
void enable(void) - Turns on the magnetometer and accelerometer
void read(void) - Takes a reading and stores the values in the vectors a and m.
int heading(void) - Returns the degrees headed away from the -Y axis
int heading(vector from) - Returns the degrees headed away from from
